- Always check for contract audits and open-source code.
- Beware of projects with anonymous teams and no social presence.
- Watch for red flags: honeypots, rugpull patterns, renounced ownership.
- Use tools like TokenSniffer, Etherscan, and DEXTools for due diligence.
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
