    - Always check for contract audits and open-source code.
    - Beware of projects with anonymous teams and no social presence.
    - Watch for red flags: honeypots, rugpull patterns, renounced ownership.
    - Use tools like TokenSniffer, Etherscan, and DEXTools for due diligence.
    - Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

    This app now supports a wide range of technical indicators and financial models for meme-stock and meme-coin derivatives/futures trading.

    ### Supported Technical Indicators
    - **Implied Volatility (IV):** Measures expected future volatility from options prices.
    - **Historical Volatility:** Actual past price fluctuations.
    - **Average True Range (ATR):** Captures market volatility.
    - **Bollinger Bands:** Identifies volatility expansions/contractions.
    - **Moving Averages (SMA/EMA):** Trend direction and crossovers.
    - **MACD:** Trend-following momentum indicator.
    - **ADX:** Trend strength.
    - **RSI, Stochastic Oscillator:** Overbought/oversold signals.
    - **On-Balance Volume (OBV):** Confirms trends via volume.
    - **VWAP:** Intraday price benchmark.
    - **Open Interest:** Trend strength in derivatives.
    - **Put/Call Ratio:** Market sentiment from options.
    - **Skewness/Kurtosis:** Tail-risk, fat tails.
    - **Gamma Exposure (GEX):** Predicts gamma squeezes (if options data exists).
    - **Sharpe/Sortino Ratio:** Risk-adjusted returns.
    - **Max Drawdown:** Largest historical loss.
    - **Value at Risk (VaR):** Quantifies potential losses.

    ### Advanced Financial Frameworks

    #### **Black-Scholes Model**
    - Used for pricing European-style options.
    - Assumes log-normal returns, constant volatility, and no early exercise.
    - **Inputs:** Spot price, strike, time to expiry, risk-free rate, volatility.
    - **Scope:** Fast, analytic, but less flexible for American options or path-dependent payoffs.

    #### **Binomial/Trinomial Trees**
    - Flexible, stepwise models for option pricing.
    - Can handle American options (early exercise), dividends, and more complex payoffs.
    - **Binomial:** Each step, price moves up or down.
    - **Trinomial:** Each step, price moves up, down, or stays flat (more accurate for some derivatives).
    - **Scope:** More computationally intensive, but can model a wider range of option types than Black-Scholes.

    #### **Kelly Criterion**
    - Formula for optimal position sizing to maximize long-term capital growth.
    - **Inputs:** Win probability and win/loss ratio.
    - **Scope:** Useful for sizing bets/trades in high-volatility meme markets, but assumes you can estimate probabilities accurately.

    #### **Monte Carlo Simulations**
    - Uses random sampling to simulate thousands of possible price paths.
    - Can model path-dependent options, exotic derivatives, and stress-test strategies.
    - **Scope:** Most flexible, but computationally intensive. Useful for risk management and scenario analysis.

    ---

    **How They Relate:**
    - **Black-Scholes** is a closed-form solution for a specific case (European options). **Binomial/Trinomial Trees** generalize this to more complex/realistic scenarios (American options, dividends).
    - **Kelly Criterion** is for position sizing, not pricing, but can use outputs from any pricing model.
    - **Monte Carlo** can simulate any scenario, including those handled by Black-Scholes and binomial trees, and more exotic ones.

    **How to Use in the App:**
    - Choose your indicator/model from the analytics or backtesting pages.
    - For options analytics, input required parameters (spot, strike, expiry, volatility, etc.).
    - Use risk metrics (Sharpe, VaR, Max Drawdown) to assess strategy safety.
    - See this Education page for explanations, and check tooltips/help on each page for model-specific guidance.

    st.header("Step-by-Step: Using Advanced Models in the App")
    st.markdown("""
    #### **Black-Scholes Model**
    - Go to the Derivatives/Options Analytics page.
    - Enter spot price (S), strike price (K), time to expiry (T, in years), risk-free rate (r), and volatility (sigma).
    - Choose call or put. The app will compute the fair value using Black-Scholes.

    #### **Binomial/Trinomial Trees**
    - Use this for American options or where early exercise/dividends matter.
    - Enter the same parameters as Black-Scholes, plus number of steps.
    - The app will show the tree-calculated value and compare to Black-Scholes.

    #### **Kelly Criterion**
    - Go to the Position Sizing/Backtesting module.
    - Enter your estimated win probability and win/loss ratio.
    - The app will suggest the optimal fraction of capital to risk.

    #### **Monte Carlo Simulations**
    - Use for stress-testing strategies or pricing exotic/path-dependent options.
    - Enter model parameters (as above), number of simulations, and see the distribution of possible outcomes.
    - The app will visualize the range of results and risk metrics.

    **Tip:**
    - Each analytics page has tooltips and links back to this Education page for detailed help.
    - Example inputs and explanations are provided on each form.
    - For further reading, see the FAQ or reach out via the feedback form.
